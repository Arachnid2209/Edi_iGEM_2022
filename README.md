# Edi_iGEM_2022
GitHub repository for Edinburgh-UHAS Ghana iGEM 2022 team

Hi everyone! Here is the GitHub repository where we will be storing our code and mathematical modelling.

In the folder LAMP_primers you will see the data I have generated to make the LAMP primers, as well as the scripts I wrote.
Please when you are adding code make sure it is well annotated so we can follow your thought process.

Cheers,

-Maarten
